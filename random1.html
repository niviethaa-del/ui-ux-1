        <h1>UI/UX</h1> <br>
        <p>UI/UX stands for User Interface and User Experience, and it refers to how a digital product looks and how it feels to use. UI focuses on the visual elements such as buttons, colors, fonts, icons, and layouts that users interact with on a website or app. UX, on the other hand, focuses on the overall experience of the user, including ease of use, navigation, accessibility, and how efficiently the product helps users achieve their goals. While UI is about making the product visually attractive, UX is about making it meaningful, smooth, and user-friendly. Together, UI and UX ensure that a product is not only good-looking but also functional, intuitive, and satisfying to use.
